1)Ideally, you'll want as many threads as processes you need to be run in parallel. So if you need 4 processes, launch 4 threads. But you are still limited to the amount of threads your processor has.

2)You can launch multiple threads, but it is possible for the scheduler to assign them to the same core, making them wait to run. It can also happen if you were to call more processes than threads you can support at once, it'll cause some processes to be queued, causing some to not run in parallel until a thread is free.
